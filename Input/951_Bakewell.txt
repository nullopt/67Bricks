951. Raspberry Bakewell Cake by Benjamin Bakewell [2014-11-09]

This simple almondy cake is a great way of using up pick-your-own raspberries.

Ingredients:
140g Ground Almond
140g Butter, softened
140g Golden Caster Sugar
140g Self-raising Flour
2 Eggs
1tsp Vanilla Extract
250g Raspberries
2 tbsp Flaked Almond
Icing Sugar, to serve

Method:
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and base-line and grease a deep 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Blitz the ground almonds, butter, sugar, flour, eggs and vanilla extract in a food processor until well combined.
Spread half the mix over the cake tin and smooth over the top. Scatter the raspberries over, then dollop the remaining cake mixture on top and roughly spread – you might find this easier to do with your fingers. Scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 50 mins until golden. Cool, remove from the tin and dust with icing sugar to serve.
